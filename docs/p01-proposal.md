## Abstract
Our main question is what the impacts of ocean acidification on ecosystems and economies are. This question is important because the impacts of ocean acidification are detrimental to not only the environment but also society as a whole. To address this question we will compare different datasets that analyze the pH levels of different bodies of water, and the impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms and shellfish industries.

## 1.0 Introduction
Since the industrial revolution, humans have been putting massive amounts of CO2 into earth’s atmosphere. Our oceans absorb almost a quarter of this output, creating a natural buffer to slow the warming of the planet. The absorbed CO2 then chemically reacts with water to form bicarbonate, an acid, raising the pH of our oceans. The goal of this project is to inform constituents on the current and potential danger that ocean acidification poses both to the existence of certain marine life and related industries. We will visualize data to show the changing ocean acid levels, and explain the impact of those levels on different marine ecosystems and the economies that rely on them. We hope to make an argument for the protection of marine life and the communities that rely on it.

## 2.0 Design Situation
#### Project Framing
Our project is framed around a collective concern for ocean health, and a desire to further understand how human-produced CO2 is impacting marine species. Furthermore, we want to understand how this comes back around to affect humans, from both ecological and economic perspectives. We are framing this as a project of comparisons, where we hope to make connections between different datasets in order to create a broader understanding of the various ways in which people and the environment are impacted.
#### Human Values
The human values we hope to embody within this project span a large range, with a few points of concentration. The main value we have is a concern for environmental sustainability, as ocean acidification has a potential to significantly impact marine ecosystems. We are also concerned with environmental justice, as the largest contributors of CO2 (and thus acidification) are not necessarily those who will be the most impacted. This also ties into values of food sovereignty and safety for all coastal peoples.

#### Direct Stakeholders
Our workgroup, the teaching team, and any users of the end data product.

#### Indirect Stakeholders
The range of indirect stakeholders has the potential to be quite broad, as ocean health and consequently the health of marine life affects all people. In particular, shellfish industry professionals, communities who depend on marine life as a food source, and coastal groups of people may all be impacted by the product of our project.

#### Possible Harms and Benefits
It is our hope that this project will benefit people by providing important data on the current effects of ocean acidification, leading to increased interest in the issue and a broader effort to address this problem. A possible harm of our work could come from a lack of particular expertise in oceanography, leading us to miss important information or ask the wrong questions of our data. This, in turn, could direct our stakeholder’s attention away from more actionable issues and towards what we focus on. We hope to minimize the risk of these harms by consulting existing research before beginning our project, in order to become more well-informed as to the current body of knowledge.

## 3.0 Research Questions
Our research questions are generally motivated by data feminist ideology, asking what is changing and what people and life will suffer because of these changes. <br><br>Our first question is **What are current oceanic pH levels and how have they changed?** It is important to show that there is a change, and show where we are in time.<br><br> Our second question is **How might these changes impact ecosystems?** Knowing how our natural world is impacted by climate change is tricky, especially with biological mechanisms, but rising acid levels could pose a threat to the existence of certain species, if not entire ecosystems. <br><br>Our third question is **How will humans and human industries be impacted by ecosystem changes?** We want people to care about this issue, we need people to empathize with the marine life that may be wiped out and relate to the struggles of the people who will suffer because of that.

## 4.0 The Dataset
#### Origin
This dataset originates from the National Centers for Environmental Information, and was recorded along the surrounding shoreline of the North American continent. The purpose of recording the data was to track the ocean acidification levels along the entire continental shelves of North America. Prior to the collection of this data, most of the data collected regarding ocean acidification was collected in the open ocean (Jiang, 2021). This dataset aims to provide insight into ocean acidification levels in coastal waters in order to make a connection between coastal fisheries and the rise in ocean acidification levels. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) funded the research and collection of this data as they also wished to understand the impact of ocean acidification on marine resources (Jiang, 2021).

#### Size
This is a large dataset that was collected over two decades made up of over 3,000 oceanographic profiles from 61 research ships. There are over 28,000 observations made in the dataset, each with multiple variables recorded.

#### Complexity
The dataset is relatively complex with 14 variables measured for each observation. While we are mainly interested in the pH reading for each observation, the dataset does contain other useful information such as dissolved inorganic carbon concentration, total alkalinity, and fugacity of carbon dioxide which can all provide useful insight into the overall research regarding ocean acidification. It is important to note as well that the data was collected from multiple sites along the North American coasts, increasing the overall complexity of the data and allowing us to gain insight into the greater impact of ocean acidification. It is important to note that while we are interested in the impact of ocean acidification on ecosystems and economies, this dataset focuses solely on ocean chemistry making no observations of micro or macro marine life or economic changes. This means that our next steps will be to find data that makes observations of these changes during the same time period to draw meaningful correlations.

## 5.0 Expected Implications
Ocean acidification decreases the amount of carbonate which is a key building block for marine organisms making it difficult for marine organisms such as plankton and coral to form shells and skeletons. Ocean acidification has economic and societal impacts as well by impacting the fishing industry and tourism. Ocean acidification also threatens coral reefs which are imperative to our survival because we rely on them for food, coastal protection, medicines and tourism dollars. The corrosion of oceans through CO2 emissions alters marine resources availability indirectly leading to job losses within the fishing industry and directly impacting the way of life for coastal communities. The indirect and direct implications of ocean acidification show that it is an increasing global threat from policymakers and coastal communities to the fishing industry.

## 6.0 Limitations
While we are confident that we can produce valuable research on the impact of ocean acidification, there are some limitations that we need to address. Currently, the data that we collected only contains observations made by oceanographers along the North American coast. Marine life in North American aquatic ecosystems can differ from that of other oceanic regions. This limits our ability to apply our findings beyond the scope of aquatic ecosystems on the North American coast. Another limitation that should be considered is that ocean acidification is a relatively recent phenomenon (Smithsonian, 2019). While we may be able to find data regarding the recent increase in ocean acidification and a correlation to an impact in marine life, it may be difficult to extend these conclusions beyond our immediate observations. It is difficult to draw conclusions about how future marine life will be affected by current increases in ocean acidificiation.
